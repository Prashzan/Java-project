Before running the project you need to considered following things:

1. Initially, import the "cruise_excursion.sql" in XAMPP or AMPP.
2. Also, run the server from  the IDE before executing the "cruise_excursion" executable jar file.
3. There is only one main method in "Homepage" class. So, "Homepage" class should be executed first while running program through IDE.
4. If you want to login as admin, insert username and password both as "admin" in login page.
